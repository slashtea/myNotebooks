## This repo contains notebooks where I work on some datasets and apply machine learning. It's purpose is to share and learn.


### Current notebooks are 
* **Nobel prize** winners analysis there's an analysis on the evolution of nobel price winners and winnings by gender as well as some visual EDA. 

* **Drunk Iowa** this dataset includes Breathalyzer tests check the notebook for analysis details !

- DGA (Domain Generation algorithm) which is basically an algorithm that generates a lot of random domain names, this notebook **(messy, got another version...will upload it later)** is a small part from my masters thesis project where we worked on a model which differentiates between a legit domain name and a random domain name.

- Titanic dataset data analyses from kaggle. Where the goal is to **predict whether a passenger will survive or not**.

- Moby Dick book **word frequency analysis** using **nltk**, **requests** and **bs4**.

- Linux repo commits analysis, in analysis we get the most productive year in terms of commits within the python project. We also get to see the most productive contributers. Guess who's the most productive one ?

- Housing dataset from kaggle competition, this kernel includes data **imputation** and a basic introduction **XGBoost**.

- Airplanes dataset analysis with pyspark.
