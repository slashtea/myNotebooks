## This repo contains notebook where I work on some datasets and apply machine learning. It's purpose is to share and learn.


### Current notebooks are 
- DGA (Domain Generation algorithm) which is basically an algorithm that generates a lot of random domain names, this notebook **(messy, got another version...will upload it later)** differentiates between a legit domain name and a random one.

- Titanic dataset data analyses from kaggle. Where the goal is to predict whether a passenger will survive or not.
