## This repo contains notebook where I work on some datasets and apply machine learning. It's purpose is to share and learn.


### Current notebooks are 
- DGA (Domain Generation algorithm) which is basically an algorithm that generates a lot of random domain names, this notebook **(messy, got another version...will upload it later)** differentiates between a legit domain name and a random name.

- Titanic dataset data analyses from kaggle. Where the goal is to predict whether a passenger will survive or not.

- Moby Dick book word frequency analysis using nltk, requests and bs4.

- Linux repo commits analysis, in analysis we get the most productive year in terms of commits within the python project. We also get to see the most productive contributers. Guess who's the most productive one ?
